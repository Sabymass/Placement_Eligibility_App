  - Programming Skills
  - Soft Skills
  - Placement Info
- Download individual student details in Excel format

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                -> Main Streamlit application
â”œâ”€â”€ db_config.py          -> Database configuration (credentials)
â”œâ”€â”€ db_connector.py       -> Handles all database interactions and queries
â”œâ”€â”€ student_manager.py    -> Provides business logic for managing student data (optional abstraction layer)
â”œâ”€â”€ exporter.py           -> Exports selected student data into Excel format
â”œâ”€â”€ Certs/                -> SSL certificate for TiDB (e.g., isrgrootx1.pem)
â””â”€â”€ README.txt            -> Project documentation (this file)
